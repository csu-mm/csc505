# Python Program: Module 2: Critical Thinking
# Created by Mukul Mondal
# Saturday, July 26th, 2025

'''
Problem statement:

Consider the following Waterfall Model. Carefully study and identify some of its inherent shortcomings. 
Then, using your list of shortcomings, design a modified Waterfall Model called YourLastName Model.

Using UML diagram of your choice, draft YourLastName Diagram making sure you clearly indicate your additions.

Implement the YourLastName class using Python, 
which will prompt the user to input the key elements of the diagram and 
return these objects in a well-formatted output.
