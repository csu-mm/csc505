Problem statement:
Common Personality Traits

... Using your personal experience and observation of people who are excellent software developers, 
use a UML diagram of your choice to depict three personality traits that appear to be common among 
them. Write a Python Script that will print a brief description and names and number of the important 
steps in your program. Use OODesign.com's Builder Pattern, ...
